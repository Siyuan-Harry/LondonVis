# LondonVis

In this repo I post one of my courseworks of UCL MSc Data Science & Public Policy programme. In this coursework I visualised education levels, crime rates, etc., for each Post district in London, and carried some regressions to explore the relationship of crime and education status, employment rate, etc, in regional level. 

In this repo:

* *first_coursework_report.pdf* is my coursework report paper
* *main_code.R* is main part of my code (submitted version), including data import, cleaning, wrangling, visualisation and modelling.
* all visualisations can be found in *plots* folder.
* Other files named *census2021-xxx*, *London_crime* and *metropolitan_crime* are data sources contributed for this analysis. But they are not complete because some of the dataset I use was too huge to be uploaded to GitHub repo.

A lot of thanks to Louis from https://geolytix.co.uk/ for providing me [London Postal dataset](https://geolytix.cn/blog/uk-postal/), which contains high-quality and precise geographical data for post districts' in London. This dataset plays foundamental role of helping me finish this coursework.

Lastly, I found visualising London map quite interesting and think this is a nice way to understand this city where I live in. This course work is very immature for now, however I may update my further explorations to this repo in the future. Thanks for viewing.
